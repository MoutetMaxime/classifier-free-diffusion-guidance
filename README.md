# Classifier-Free Guidance Diffusion

This repository contains the **Classifier-Free Guidance Diffusion** project, developed as part of the **Generative Models** course taught by Alain Durmus at **√âcole Polytechnique**. This project explores and implements concepts from the paper ["Classifier-Free Diffusion Guidance"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04775), which introduces innovative methods to guide diffusion models effectively during sampling.

## üìö Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to deeply understand the *Classifier-Free Guidance* mechanism to simplify diffusion pipelines and improve the quality of generated results. This approach guides diffusion models without requiring an external classifier, making the process more flexible and efficient.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Content
1. **Paper Review**:
   - Summary and explanation of key concepts.
   - Analysis of the theoretical implications for generative modeling.

2. **Implementation**:
   - Development of a guidance mechanism for diffusion models without a classifier.
   - Training and evaluation scripts for the model.

3. **Experiments**:
   - Tests to evaluate the quality of samples generated using the guidance mechanism.
   - Comparison with other diffusion guidance techniques.

4. **Results**:
   - Visualizations and metrics demonstrating the impact of *Classifier-Free Guidance*.
   - Discussion of the advantages and limitations of this approach.
